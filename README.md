## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Python-based data analysis script that explores and visualizes student performance data from a CSV file. It uses the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib + Seaborn for insightful visualizations.

The dataset includes scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, along with demographic factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. 🔧 Install Dependencies

Make sure Python 3.x is installed. Then run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

2. ▶️ Run the Script
python task1_csv_analysis.py

📊 Visualizations Included
Average Scores Comparison Bar Chart
Math vs Reading Scores Scatter Plot
Score Correlation Heatmap
These visualizations help in identifying patterns, comparing performance, and understanding relationships between scores.

📈 Key Insights from the Dataset
📚 Reading and writing scores are strongly correlated.
👩 Female students tend to outperform male students in reading and writing.
🍔 Students who completed a test preparation course generally scored higher.
🎓 Parental education level impacts performance, especially in math.
